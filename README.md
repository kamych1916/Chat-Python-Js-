# Client-Server chat

## Technologies
#### Serever side
* Python, Django (web-framework)
* Database - sqlite3
* I used Django-ORM to manipulate the database.

#### Client side
* HTML + CSS, and Bootstrap4
* All logic client side construct on JS (and little-bit on Jquery)

## Install project
* Python 3.6+
* Clone this git repositorie to your PC
* Write in terminal - python manage.py runserver

## A few words about the project
* Web-design is not great, there are a lot of problems with cross-browser
* To check the last message I used the idea of a "long poll"
* If you do not want to register in the system, you can use this account:
* ###### log - kamol, 
* ###### pass - 12345678
